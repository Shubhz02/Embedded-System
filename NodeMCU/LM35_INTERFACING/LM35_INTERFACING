Introduction
In this project, the NodeMCU (ESP8266) is used to read an analog temperature sensor value. The sensor is connected to the A0 pin on the NodeMCU, 
and the temperature is calculated and displayed on the Serial Monitor. The program reads the analog value from the sensor, converts it to the corresponding voltage, 
and then calculates the temperature in Celsius based on the sensor's characteristics.

Working Principle
The NodeMCU (ESP8266) has a built-in ADC (Analog to Digital Converter) that converts the analog voltage from a sensor to a digital value between 0 and 1023.
This range corresponds to a voltage between 0V and 3.3V (the reference voltage).

The temperature sensor produces an analog voltage that is proportional to the temperature.

The code reads this value from A0, converts it to a corresponding voltage, and then uses a simple formula to calculate the temperature
(assuming a linear relationship between voltage and temperature).

Working Steps:
The NodeMCU reads an analog voltage from the A0 pin.
The analog value is then converted into a real-world voltage.
The temperature is calculated using the formula:

Temperature (°C) = Analog Value ×(3.3 /1023 )× 100

(This formula assumes that 1 unit of voltage corresponds to 1 degree Celsius in the sensor.)
The temperature is printed to the Serial Monitor every second.


Connections
Temperature Sensor: Connect the VCC pin of the sensor to 3.3V of the NodeMCU.
Connect the GND pin of the sensor to the GND pin of the NodeMCU.
Connect the Analog Output pin of the sensor to the A0 pin on the NodeMCU.


Code Explanation
> Sensor Reading:
The analogRead(A0) function reads the analog voltage from the sensor.

> Voltage Calculation:
float resolution = vref/1023; defines the voltage per unit of the ADC reading (for a 3.3V reference voltage).
temperature = (temperature*resolution); converts the ADC reading into a voltage.

> Temperature Calculation:
temperature = temperature*100; converts the voltage into a temperature in Celsius (assuming a direct relationship where 1V = 1°C).

> Output:
The temperature is printed to the Serial Monitor using Serial.println(temperature); every second, showing the temperature value.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to interface an analog temperature sensor with the NodeMCU (ESP8266) and display the temperature readings on the Serial Monitor.
This is a basic project that helps you understand how to work with analog sensors and ADC readings on the NodeMCU. You can modify the sensor or
apply more complex formulas to handle more sophisticated temperature sensors in the future.

By adjusting the formula or scaling factor, you can use this same setup with a variety of different temperature sensors.
