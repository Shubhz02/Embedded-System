HC-05 Bluetooth Module Interfacing with LPC2148

HC-05 is a Bluetooth device used for wireless communication. It works on serial communication (UART).
It is a 6-pin module.
The device can be used in 2 modes; data mode and command mode.
The data mode is used for data transfer between devices whereas command mode is used for changing the settings of the Bluetooth module.
AT commands are required in command mode.
The module works on 5V or 3.3V. It has an onboard 5V to 3.3V regulator.
As HC-05 Bluetooth module has 3.3 V level for RX/TX and the microcontroller can detect 3.3 V level, so, no need to shift transmit level of the HC-05 module.
But we need to shift the transmit voltage level from the microcontroller to RX of HC-05 module.

Note : Default Bluetooth name of the device is “HC-05” and default PIN (password) for connection is either “0000” or “1234”.
