 Bluetooth Module Interfacing with Arduino

 Introduction
Bluetooth communication is widely used in embedded systems for wireless data transfer. The HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth module allows Arduino to communicate with
other Bluetooth-enabled devices like smartphones, tablets, or PCs. This guide explains how to interface the Bluetooth module with Arduino using SoftwareSerial.

 Working Principle
The HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth module** operates on serial communication (UART protocol). It sends and receives data wirelessly using Bluetooth technology.
The module communicates with the Arduino via TX (Transmit) and RX (Receive) pins at a predefined baud rate (typically 9600 bps).
The SoftwareSerial library enables serial communication on other digital pins of the Arduino, freeing up the default serial port.

Connections
>Components Required:
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- HC-05/HC-06 Bluetooth Module
- Jumper Wires

 Wiring:
Bluetooth Module Pin               Connection to Arduino 
VCC                                    5V                   
GND                                    GND                  
TX                                     Pin 2 (RX of Arduino) 
RX                                     Pin 3 (TX of Arduino) 

 Steps to Implement
1. Connect the Bluetooth Module:
   - Connect VCC to 5V on Arduino.
   - Connect GND to GND on Arduino.
   - Connect TX of Bluetooth module to Pin 2 (RX) on Arduino.
   - Connect RX of Bluetooth module to Pin 3 (TX) on Arduino.

2. Upload the Code:
   - Use the SoftwareSerial library to communicate with the Bluetooth module.
   - Upload the Bluetooth data transmission code via Arduino IDE.

3. Pair with a Bluetooth Device:
   - Enable Bluetooth on your smartphone or PC.
   - Search for available Bluetooth devices and pair with HC-05 (Default PIN: 1234 )
   - Use a serial communication app (like Bluetooth Terminal) to send and receive data.

4. Monitor Data:
   - Open the Serial Monitor in Arduino IDE.
   - Observe incoming data from the Bluetooth module in real-time.
