PIC18F4550 External Interrupt


Introduction
-Interrupts are the signals which alter the flow of an executing program by causing the microcontroller jumps to the Interrupt Service Routine to serve to interrupt. 
-These interrupts are given to the microcontroller unit through the external pins of the microcontroller.
-Once the controller completes the routine, it returns to the location from where it had made a jump.
-In cases where interrupts are not used, the program would need to constantly poll the input signals to monitor external events for catching the pulses when they occurred.
-But in some cases, the program can miss an event.  
-E.g. An infrared slot sensor trying to catch a coin drop. 
-In this situation, using an interrupt can free the microcontroller to get some other work done while not missing the input. In such cases, external interrupts are used.


*External Interrupt Pins*
PIC18F4550 has three external hardware interrupts - INT0, INT1, and INT2. They are on PORTB pins RB0, RB1, and RB2
These interrupts are edge-triggered interrupts i.e. triggered by either a rising edge or by a falling edge.

The edge trigger bit is present in an INTCON2 register.
