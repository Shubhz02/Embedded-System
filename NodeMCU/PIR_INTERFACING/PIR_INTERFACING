Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use a PIR (Passive Infrared) sensor with the NodeMCU (ESP8266) to detect motion and control an LED based on the motion detected by the sensor. 
When the PIR sensor detects motion, it sends a HIGH signal, which turns the LED on. If no motion is detected, the LED remains off.

Working Principle
The PIR sensor detects infrared radiation, which is emitted by humans or animals. When motion is detected, the sensor outputs a HIGH signal, and when no motion is detected, 
it outputs a LOW signal.

The NodeMCU (ESP8266) reads the signal from the PIR sensor and controls the state of the LED based on this input:
If the sensor detects motion (PIR sensor output is HIGH), the LED is turned ON.
If no motion is detected (PIR sensor output is LOW), the LED is turned OFF.


Connections
PIR Sensor:
VCC pin to 3.3V on the NodeMCU.
GND pin to GND on the NodeMCU.
OUT pin to D1 (GPIO5) on the NodeMCU.

LED:
The longer leg (anode) connects to D4 (GPIO2) on the NodeMCU.
The shorter leg (cathode) connects to GND via a 220-ohm resistor.


Code Explanation
The code uses the PIR sensor to detect motion and turn an LED on or off based on the motion status.

> Pin Setup: The PIR sensor is connected to D1 (GPIO5) and the LED is connected to D4 (GPIO2).
pinMode(PIR_Input, INPUT); sets D1 as the input pin for the PIR sensor.
pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); sets D4 as the output pin to control the LED.

> Main Logic:
digitalWrite(LED, digitalRead(PIR_Input)); reads the signal from the PIR sensor and sets the LED accordingly:
If the PIR sensor outputs HIGH (motion detected), the LED is turned ON.
If the PIR sensor outputs LOW (no motion detected), the LED is turned OFF.

> Delay: The delay(10); ensures that the loop runs every 10 milliseconds, preventing excessive polling of the PIR sensor and stabilizing the system.

Conclusion
This project illustrates the basic concept of motion detection using a PIR sensor with the NodeMCU (ESP8266). The motion detection is used to control an LED, 
which can be a simple first step in building home automation systems or security systems. The NodeMCU is a versatile platform for controlling various sensors and actuators in real-time.

You can further enhance this project by adding notifications or alerts when motion is detected or integrating the system with IoT platforms for remote monitoring.
