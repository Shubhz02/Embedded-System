DHT11 Sensor Interfacing with ARM LPC2148

DHT11 is a single wire digital humidity and temperature sensor, which provides humidity and temperature values serially.
It can measure relative humidity in percentage (20 to 90% RH) and temperature in degree Celsius in the range of 0 to 50Â°C.
It has 4 pins of which 2 pins are used for supply, 1 is not used and the last one is used for data.
The data pin is the only pin used for communication. Pulses of different TON and TOFF are decoded as logic 1 or logic 0 or start pulse or end of the frame.

 Reading temperature and humidity from DHT11 sensor.
Here, the Data Pin of DHT11 is connected to P0.4 of LPC2148. UART0 is used for displaying data on a serial monitor on a PC/laptop.
