Introduction
This project demonstrates how to connect and use an LCD (Liquid Crystal Display) with an I2C interface on an Arduino. 
The program initializes the LCD screen and displays a test message on the first row, followed by a "Hello, World!" message on the second row, which updates every 2 seconds.

Working Principle
The I2C protocol allows communication between the Arduino and the LCD using only two data lines: SDA (Serial Data) and SCL (Serial Clock), 
making it more efficient than using multiple digital pins for a parallel LCD. The LCD is controlled through the LiquidCrystal_I2C library,
which simplifies the interaction with the I2C LCD. The display shows static messages, and the second line updates every 2 seconds with a new message.

Connections
To connect the I2C LCD to your Arduino, use the following pin connections:
VCC (LCD) → 5V (Arduino)
GND (LCD) → GND (Arduino)
SDA (LCD) → A4 (Arduino Uno) (or the equivalent SDA pin for your Arduino model)
SCL (LCD) → A5 (Arduino Uno) (or the equivalent SCL pin for your Arduino model)

Ensure that the I2C address used in the code (0x27) matches the address of your LCD module. Some modules may use a different address, such as 0x3F.

Code Explanation
Library Import: The code imports the Wire and LiquidCrystal_I2C libraries. Wire is used to communicate over the I2C bus, and LiquidCrystal_I2C handles interactions with the LCD.
LCD Initialization: The lcd.begin(16, 2) function initializes the LCD screen with a width of 16 characters and 2 rows.
Setup Function: In the setup() function, the LCD is initialized, the backlight is turned on with lcd.backlight(), and an initial message "LCD Connected!" is displayed on the first row.
Loop Function: The loop() function moves the cursor to the second row (lcd.setCursor(0, 1)) and displays "Hello, World!" for 2 seconds before refreshing.


Conclusion
This project provides a simple and effective way to connect and use an I2C LCD with an Arduino.
It shows the basic setup and the use of the LiquidCrystal_I2C library to display messages on the LCD. 
This setup can be extended to display dynamic data or additional information for more complex projects.
