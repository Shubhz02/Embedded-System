Introduction to SPI Communication Protocol

Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI) is a synchronous serial data protocol generally used for quick communication over short distances.

-SPI is a synchronous protocol that allows a master device (usually microcontroller) to initiate communication with a slave device.
-It is a full-duplex communication protocol.
-SPI uses separate clock and data lines with a select line to select the device with which we want to communicate.
-SPI generally used to communicate quickly with devices like SD card, EEPROM chips, some of the TI ADCs, etc.
-It can communicate with multiple slaves.

*There are four basic pins used in PIC18F4550 SPI communication which are:

1. SCK: (Serial Clock)-
The clock signal (SCK) is provided by the master to provide synchronization.
Only the master device can control the clock line, SCK.

2. SDI: (Serial Data In)
SDI is the serial data input which carries data into the device.

3. SDO: (Serial Data Out)          
This is the Serial data output signal. It carries data out of the device.

4. SS: (Slave Select)           
It is a slave select signal. In master mode, we can use it to choose the device (slave) with which we wish to communicate.
This is an active low signal, so a low on this line will indicate the SPI is active.
When multiple slaves are used then GPIO pins of the microcontroller are used to select slave devices.

A) SSPSTAT: SSP Status Register for SPI mode
B) SSPCON1: SSP Control Register for SPI mode
