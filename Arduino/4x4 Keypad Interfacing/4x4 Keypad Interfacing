4x4 Matrix Keypad with Arduino

Introduction
  A 4x4 Matrix Keypad is a commonly used input device that allows users to enter numeric, alphanumeric, or custom commands into an embedded system. 
It consists of 16 keys arranged in a 4-row by 4-column matrix. This keypad is widely used in password-protected systems, automation, security access, and many other applications.

Working Principle
  The 4x4 matrix keypad is designed in a way that reduces the number of required I/O pins. Instead of assigning one pin per key (which would require 16 pins),
the keys are connected in a row-column configuration. This arrangement allows us to detect key presses by scanning the matrix.
  Each key is placed at the intersection of a row and a column. When a key is pressed, it completes a circuit between a specific row and a column.
The microcontroller detects the pressed key by systematically applying signals to the rows and checking which column registers the signal.

Steps to Detect a Key Press:
1)Set all columns as input with pull-up resistors enabled and all rows as output.
2)Pull each row LOW one at a time while checking the columns for a LOW signal.
3)If a column reads LOW when a row is active, the corresponding key has been pressed.
4)Decode the pressed key by mapping it to the appropriate row and column values.
