ADC Interfacing with Arduino

Introduction
Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADC) allow microcontrollers to read analog signals and convert them into digital values.
This guide explains how to interface an analog sensor, such as a potentiometer, with an Arduino using its built-in ADC functionality.

Working Principle
An ADC converts continuous analog voltage signals into discrete digital values. Arduino boards, like the Arduino Uno, have a 10-bit ADC,
meaning they can represent an analog input voltage with values from 0 to 1023 The conversion follows the formula:

Digital Value = (Analog Voltage / Reference Voltage) * 1023 

For example, if the input voltage is 2.5V with a 5V reference, the digital value will be 511

Connections
>Components Required:
- Arduino Uno (or compatible board)
- Potentiometer (or any analog sensor)
- Jumper wires

Wiring:
Sensor Pin                  Connection to Arduino 

VCC                                5V                   
GND                                GND                  
Signal Out                     A0 (Analog Pin)      

Steps to Implement
1. Connect the Sensor:
   - VCC to 5V on the Arduino.
   - GND to GND on the Arduino.
   - Analog output to A0 on the Arduino.

2. Upload the Code:
   - Open the Arduino IDE.
   - Write and upload the ADC reading code.

3. View Output:
   - Open the Serial Monitor(9600 baud rate) to observe the changing ADC values.

Conclusion
This guide covered interfacing an analog sensor with an Arduino using the built-in ADC. 
The analogRead() function converts an analog signal into a digital value, enabling sensor data monitoring for various applications like automation and IoT systems.
