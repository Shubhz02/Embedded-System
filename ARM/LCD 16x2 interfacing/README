LCD 16x2 interfacing with LPC2148 (8-bit mode)

LCDs (Liquid Crystal Displays) are used for displaying status or parameters in embedded systems.
LCD 16x2 is 16 pin device which has 8 data pins (D0-D7) and 3 control pins (RS, RW, EN). The remaining 5 pins are for supply and backlight for the LCD.
The control pins help us configure the LCD in command mode or data mode. They also help configure read mode or write mode and also when to read or write.
LCD 16x2 can be used in 4-bit mode or 8-bit mode depending on the requirement of the application. In order to use it we need to send certain commands to 
the LCD in command mode and once the LCD is configured according to our need, we can send the required data in data mode to display on it.

CD Data pins D0-D7 are connected to pins P0.8-P0.15 of Port 0.
LCD control pins RS, RW and EN are connected to P0.4, P0.5 P0.6 respectively.
