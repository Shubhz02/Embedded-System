4x4 Keypad interfacing with LPC2148

Keypad is used as an input device to read the key pressed by the user and to process it.
4x4 keypad consists of 4 rows and 4 columns. Switches are placed between the rows and columns. 
A key press establishes a connection between corresponding row and column between which the switch is placed.
In order to read the key press, we need to configure the rows as outputs and columns as inputs.
Columns are read after applying signals to the rows in order to determine whether or not a key is pressed and if pressed, which key is pressed.

Rows of the keypad R3-R0 are connected to pins P0.15-P0.12 respectively.
Columns of the keypad C3-C0 are connected to pins P0.11-P0.8 respectively.

reading the key pressed from a keypad and to display the key pressed on PC terminal using UART communication.
In this code, UART0 feature of LPC2148 has been used for displaying information regarding the key press. 
For information about UART0 in LPC2148 and how to use it, refer the topic UART in LPC2148 in the ARM7-LPC2148 inside section
