Introduction
This project uses a Rain Sensor with an Arduino to detect rainfall in real-time. The sensor’s analog output is read by the Arduino, 
and based on the sensor's value, it determines if it is raining or not. The data is then displayed on the Serial Monitor. 
If the rain sensor detects rain (i.e., the value falls below a specified threshold), a message indicating "Rain detected!" is printed. 
If no rain is detected, it prints "No rain detected."

Working Principle
The Rain Sensor detects rain by measuring the resistance change in the sensor's wet surface.
When water contacts the sensor, the resistance decreases, leading to a lower analog voltage that the Arduino reads. 
The Arduino reads the sensor value through the analog pin and compares it to a predefined threshold value. If the reading is below the threshold, 
it indicates that rain is detected; otherwise, it indicates no rain.

Connections
To connect the Rain Sensor to your Arduino, use the following pin connections:

VCC (Rain Sensor) → 5V (Arduino)
GND (Rain Sensor) → GND (Arduino)
Signal (Rain Sensor) → Analog Pin A0 (Arduino)
Ensure that you calibrate the threshold based on the sensitivity of your specific rain sensor and environmental conditions.

Code Explanation
Sensor Pin and Value: The analog pin A0 is used to read the output of the rain sensor. The reading from the sensor is stored in the rainValue variable.
Setup Function: The setup() function initializes serial communication using Serial.begin(9600), which allows the Arduino to send data to the Serial Monitor.
Loop Function: In the loop() function, the Arduino continuously reads the value from the rain sensor using analogRead(rainSensorPin) and prints the value to the Serial Monitor. 
It compares the reading to a threshold value of 500 (you can adjust this based on your sensor). If the value is less than 500, it prints "Rain detected!" to the Serial Monitor.
Otherwise, it prints "No rain detected." The loop runs every second, with a delay of 1 second (delay(1000)) before taking the next reading.


Conclusion
This simple project demonstrates how to use a Rain Sensor with Arduino to monitor rainfall. 
The sensor's analog output is read by the Arduino and compared to a threshold to detect rain. 
This setup can be used in a variety of environmental monitoring systems, 
such as automatic irrigation systems or weather stations.
