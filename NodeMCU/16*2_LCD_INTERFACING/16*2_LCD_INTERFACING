Introduction
This project demonstrates how to interface a 16x2 LCD with a NodeMCU (ESP8266) to display a static message and the number of seconds since the last reset. 
The LiquidCrystal library is used to control the LCD, and it communicates with the NodeMCU through digital pins. 
This is a basic example of how to display both static and dynamic content (such as time) on an LCD using the NodeMCU board.

Working Principle
The NodeMCU (ESP8266) controls the 16x2 LCD to display a static message ("hello, world!") on the first row. On the second row, 
the number of seconds since the program started (since the last reset) is displayed, which is continuously updated using the millis() function.
The LCD uses I2C communication, and we manually define the control pins (RS, EN, D4-D7) to control the LCD’s behavior.

Connections for NodeMCU (ESP8266)
Here’s how you should connect your 16x2 LCD to the NodeMCU (ESP8266):

LCD Pin	NodeMCU Pin
RS	D1 (GPIO5)
EN	D2 (GPIO4)
D4	D3 (GPIO0)
D5	D4 (GPIO2)
D6	D5 (GPIO14)
D7	D6 (GPIO12)
VSS	GND
VCC	3.3V
RW	GND
VO	10k Potentiometer (for contrast adjustment)

The NodeMCU operates at 3.3V logic, so connect the VCC pin of the LCD to 3.3V rather than 5V, as 3.3V should suffice to power the LCD.



Conclusion
This project allows you to use a 16x2 LCD with the NodeMCU (ESP8266) to display a static message and real-time dynamic data (time in seconds since reset).
The setup demonstrates how to interface the LCD with the NodeMCU and how to continuously update the data on the second row. This project serves as a basic example, 
and you can extend it by adding sensors or additional functionality for more complex applications.
