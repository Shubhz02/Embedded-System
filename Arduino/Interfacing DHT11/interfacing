Introduction
  This project uses the DHT11 temperature and humidity sensor with an Arduino to read environmental data.
The sensor provides real-time measurements of humidity and temperature, which are then displayed on the Serial Monitor. 
The program runs continuously, reading data from the sensor every 2 seconds.

Working Principle
The Arduino communicates with the DHT11 sensor using a digital signal. The sensor measures the temperature and humidity in its environment and sends this data to the Arduino. 
The code uses the DHT library to interface with the sensor and fetch readings. It then displays the readings on the Serial Monitor, 
where you can observe the current temperature in Celsius and humidity as a percentage.

Connections
To set up the circuit, connect the DHT11 sensor to the Arduino as follows:
VCC (DHT11) → 5V (Arduino)
GND (DHT11) → GND (Arduino)
DATA (DHT11) → Digital Pin 2 (Arduino)
Ensure that you use a 10k ohm pull-up resistor between the DATA pin and VCC to maintain a stable signal.

Code Explanation
Library Import: The code includes the DHT library, which simplifies communication with the DHT sensor.
Pin and Sensor Type: The sensor is connected to pin 2 of the Arduino, and the type of sensor is specified as DHT11.
Setup Function: The setup() function initializes the serial communication and starts the DHT sensor.
Loop Function: The loop() function continuously reads the temperature and humidity from the sensor. If the readings are valid, they are displayed on the Serial Monitor every 2 seconds. If the readings are invalid, an error message is displayed.


Conclusion
This project demonstrates the process of connecting a DHT11 sensor to an Arduino and using the DHT library to read temperature and humidity values.
The data is displayed in real-time on the Serial Monitor. This setup can be expanded to build more complex environmental monitoring systems.
