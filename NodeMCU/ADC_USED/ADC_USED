Introduction
This project demonstrates how to read the system voltage (VCC) and external voltage using the NodeMCU (ESP8266). It showcases two methods:

1) Reading external voltage via the ADC pin (A0).
2) Reading the system voltage using the built-in ESP.getVcc() function.
Both of these techniques allow you to measure voltage on the NodeMCU, which can be helpful in many applications, including battery-powered devices, 
power monitoring, or sensor calibration.

Working Principle
1) Reading External Voltage:
The NodeMCU's ADC pin (A0) is used to read the voltage applied to it. The value is then printed to the Serial Monitor. 
The analog value from the pin is read using the analogRead() function, and the value is printed on the screen.
The voltage on A0 is measured in terms of ADC value, which is between 0 and 1023 (for a 10-bit ADC). This can be mapped to a specific voltage range.

2) Reading System Voltage:
NodeMCU (ESP8266) has an internal ADC (Analog-to-Digital Converter) that can measure the systemâ€™s VCC (voltage) directly.
Using the function ESP.getVcc(), the system voltage is read and output to the Serial Monitor in millivolts (mV).
The system voltage is essential for monitoring the power supply of the NodeMCU and can be helpful in applications requiring real-time power tracking or 
ensuring consistent operation in battery-powered projects.

Connections
1) Reading External Voltage:
You can apply any external voltage (within the allowable range for the NodeMCU's A0 pin, typically 0 to 3.3V) to the A0 pin.
Make sure that the voltage applied does not exceed 3.3V, as this is the maximum allowed input for the NodeMCU's ADC pin to avoid damaging the board.

2) Reading System Voltage:
No external connections are required, as the system voltage is measured internally via the NodeMCU.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to read both external voltage through the ADC pin and system voltage directly using the NodeMCU (ESP8266).
Understanding the system voltage can help in monitoring power levels, while the ADC readings allow for the measurement of external voltage inputs, 
which can be useful for various sensor applications, power monitoring, and voltage-based triggering systems.
