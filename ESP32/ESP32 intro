Introduction to ESP32


ESP32 comes with an on-chip 32-bit microcontroller with integrated Wi-Fi + Bluetooth + BLE features that targets a wide range of applications. 
It is a series of low-power and low-cost developed by Espressif Systems.

*Features of ESP-Wroom-32*
ESP-Wroom-32 contains a low-power Tensilica Xtensa® Dual-Core 32-bit LX6 microprocessor at 240 MHz: 994.26 CoreMark; 4.14 CoreMark/MHz
448 KB of ROM for booting and core functions.
520 KB of on-chip SRAM for data and instructions.
4MB of Flash Memory
16 KB SRAM in RTC
Wi-Fi 802.11b/g/n
Bluetooth v4.2 BR/EDR and Bluetooth LE specifications

*Advanced Peripheral Interfaces*
1) GPIO: Total 32 Multifunctional GPIOs are available on the ESP-Wroom-32 development board which can be used for input/output devices. 
Every GPIO pin can be configured as an internal pull-up, pull-down, or set to high impedance. 
The input can also be set to edge-trigger or level-trigger to generate CPU interrupts.
---Note: GPIO34, GPIO35, GPIO36, and GPIO39 are the only input pins

2) ADC: On-chip 12-bit SAR (Successive Approximation Registers) ADCs (Analog to Digital Converter) which supports measurements on 16 channels of ESP32.

3) DAC: On-chip two 8-bit DAC (Digital to Analog) channels to produce digital signals into analog voltage signal outputs. 
Both DAC channels can also support independent conversions.

4) PWM: ESP32 development board has support 8-bit 32 channels PWM. The pins with the symbol ‘~’ represent that it has PWM support. 
It can be used for dimming LEDs or controlling motors etc.

5) TOUCH Pad: ESP32 has 10 capacitive sensing GPIOs, that detect physical touch by the human body. 
This technique can replace mechanical buttons and switches to eliminate mechanical wear and tear. 

6) I2C: The ESP32 development board has only one I2C bus interface (Supported in Arduino IDE). which can serve as an I2C master or slave, 
depending on the user’s configuration.
The I2C interfaces support:
Standard mode Support (100 Kbit/s)
Fast mode Support (400 Kbit/s)
Support both 7-bit and 10-bit addressing modes
Dual addressing mode


7) SPI: ESP32 has three SPIs which are SPI, HSPI, and VSPI. These SPIs also support the following general-purpose SPI features:
Four modes of SPI transfer format (depend on the polarity and the phase of the SPI clock)
Speed Up to 80 MHz 
up to 64-byte FIFO

8)UART: ESP32 development board has two UART interfaces UART0 and UART1. Both provide asynchronous communication and support to RS232, RS485, and IrDA too.
