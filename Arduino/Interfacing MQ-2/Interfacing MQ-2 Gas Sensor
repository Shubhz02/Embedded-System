Introduction
This project demonstrates how to use the MQ-2 Gas Sensor to detect gas concentrations in the environment using an Arduino. 
The sensor reads the concentration of gases like smoke, alcohol, and carbon monoxide. 
The Arduino reads the sensor's analog output and prints the sensor value to the Serial Monitor, providing real-time feedback on the gas concentration.
If the gas concentration exceeds a set threshold, a warning message is displayed.

Working Principle
The MQ-2 Gas Sensor detects various gases by measuring the change in resistance of its sensitive material in the presence of gases.
When gas molecules come into contact with the sensor, the resistance changes, and this change is converted into a voltage that the Arduino can read using its analog input. 
The Arduino then processes this value and prints the result to the Serial Monitor.

The code reads the analog value from the sensor and checks if the concentration exceeds a defined threshold. 
If it does, a warning message is displayed, indicating a high concentration of gas. Otherwise, it reports that the air quality is normal.

Connections
To connect the MQ-2 Gas Sensor to your Arduino, use the following pin connections:

VCC (MQ-2) → 5V (Arduino)
GND (MQ-2) → GND (Arduino)
A0 (MQ-2) → Analog Pin A1 (Arduino)
Ensure you adjust the threshold in the code based on your environment, as the sensor’s sensitivity may vary.

Code Explanation
Sensor Pin and Value: The analog pin A1 is used to read the output from the MQ-2 gas sensor. The sensor's reading is stored in the gasValue variable.
Setup Function: The setup() function initializes serial communication with the Serial.begin(9600) command, allowing the Arduino to send data to the Serial Monitor.
Loop Function: The loop() function continuously reads the sensor's analog value using analogRead(gasSensorPin), prints the sensor value, 
and then compares it to a threshold (400 in this case). If the value exceeds the threshold, it prints "High gas concentration detected!" Otherwise, 
it prints "Air quality is normal." The delay of 1 second (delay(1000)) ensures the readings are spaced out for easy monitoring.


Conclusion
This project provides a basic implementation of an MQ-2 Gas Sensor with Arduino. It reads the sensor's analog value and outputs it to the Serial Monitor, 
helping to monitor gas concentrations in real-time. By adjusting the threshold in the code, you can tailor the sensitivity of the sensor to your specific environment. 
This setup can be extended for various gas detection and air quality monitoring applications.
