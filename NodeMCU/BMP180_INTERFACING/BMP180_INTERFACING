Introduction
This project demonstrates how to interface the Adafruit BMP085 sensor with the NodeMCU (ESP8266) to read temperature, pressure, and altitude. 
The BMP085 is a barometer and temperature sensor that communicates with the NodeMCU using the I2C protocol. 
This sensor is commonly used for weather station applications, altitude measurement, and environmental monitoring.

Working Principle
The Adafruit BMP085 sensor uses the I2C communication protocol to exchange data with the NodeMCU. It can measure:
> Temperature in Celsius (Â°C).
> Pressure in Pascals (Pa).
> Altitude in meters, which can be calculated based on atmospheric pressure.

The BMP085 sensor returns data about the temperature and pressure, which is used to calculate the altitude using the barometric formula. 
By knowing the sea-level pressure, we can calculate a more accurate altitude measurement.

The sensor reads the temperature and pressure values continuously and can also compute the altitude assuming standard pressure values or using the measured pressure at sea level.

Connections
To connect the BMP085 sensor to NodeMCU (ESP8266) via I2C, follow the connections below:
BMP085 Pin	NodeMCU Pin
VCC	3.3V
GND	GND
SCL	D1 (GPIO5)
SDA	D2 (GPIO4)
VCC: The BMP085 operates at 3.3V and should not be connected to 5V, as that could damage the sensor.
SCL: The SCL pin of the BMP085 connects to D1 (GPIO5) on the NodeMCU for clock signals.
SDA: The SDA pin of the BMP085 connects to D2 (GPIO4) on the NodeMCU for data signals.
GND: Connect the GND of the BMP085 to the GND of the NodeMCU.


Code Explanation

bmp.begin() initializes the BMP085 sensor and checks whether it is connected properly. If the sensor is not found, it prints an error message to the Serial Monitor.
The sensor reads the temperature (in Celsius) using bmp.readTemperature().
The sensor reads the pressure (in Pascals) using bmp.readPressure().
The altitude is calculated using bmp.readAltitude() with a standard sea-level pressure of 101325 Pascals. You can also calculate the real altitude 
if you know the exact sea-level pressure.
The sea-level pressure is calculated using bmp.readSealevelPressure(), which gives the pressure at sea level.
The real altitude can be calculated if you know the exact sea-level pressure using the bmp.readAltitude(seaLevelPressure) function.
The values are printed every 500 milliseconds to the Serial Monitor.

Conclusion
This project demonstrates how to use the Adafruit BMP085 sensor with the NodeMCU (ESP8266) to measure temperature, pressure, and altitude. 
This can be used for environmental monitoring applications, such as weather stations, where temperature and atmospheric pressure are key factors in predicting weather patterns.
Additionally, knowing the altitude is useful in many applications, such as GPS tracking, drones, or hiking applications where altitude-based data is required.

With a simple I2C connection, you can interface this sensor with the NodeMCU and collect data for various environmental projects.
